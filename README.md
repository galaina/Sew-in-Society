Typography

- The Raleway font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. also the Raleway Dots font was a family font used for all headings that gave more texture. Raleway group font is a clean font and suitable in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

- Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a vibrant and aesthetically clean image that aligns with the theme of the site.
