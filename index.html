              Susanna - Our Founder and Head Design Teacher " Here at Social
              Sewing we want to create an interative space where our members
              can. learn and create in a lively environment. I have met many
              individuals who would love to learnt he bas ic skills of sewing as
              a life social skill but dont know where to turn for a personable
              experience; so it led me to form this studio space for all who
              desire to learn. practice and create can do so, with others
              members close by and have the support they require."

              knowing that we have a space in town for creatives of all levels
              to come togtehr. not only is this studio spacious, and the perfect
              environment to create but it is also a hub of community, a
              platform to network and build genuine connections. I came across
              the studio when I was searching for a space to pattern cut away
              from small single room and three years later i am so glad i
              dropped Susan that private message on Facebook!. I can not only
              work freely, but i get to help others to learn this great skill."
